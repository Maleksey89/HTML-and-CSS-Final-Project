	<h3>Why you should be lifting Weights</h3>
	<p>As technology improves our lives and less and less people engage in physical work, we see a marked rise in heart disease, diabetes, depression and various other ailments. 
	physical exersize, especially weightlifting, can help improve your personal health in many ways<p class="indent">Don't be mistaken, 
 	weightlifting won't cure your heart disease or diabetes and you should definitely consult your doctor before starting any kind of physical regiment, but studies show a huge improvement in the 
	health of most if not all individuals who begin resistance training</p><p class="indent">When most people think of the gym or weightlifting, images of men with little body fat and 
	oversized muscles are usually the first come up. The steroid fueled aggressiveness and intensity is very off-putting and prevents people from starting when we 
	create an end goal that most people can never achieve.</p><p class="indent"> This is no longer the case, most gyms, or fitness centers, are very inclusive and encourage beginners to come out
    and try them out. Fitness centers, like Planet Fitness, only charge $10 a month with no commitment needed. Now is a good a time as any to start and try to improve your health!</p>
	<p class="indent">Weightlifting AKA Strength Training AKA Resistance Training is the most superior form of exersize. No doubt about it. The benefits
	are too many to list, least of which is building muscle. One of the main reasons women choose to avoid weights is because they are afraid they will get too big. As many proffesional
	weightlifters can confirm, it is much much harder to put on muscle than simply lifting weights a few times a week.</p>
	<details>
	<p class="indent"><summary> Below are just a few benefits to weight training</summary>
	<ul>
		<li> Helps improve mood and brain health</li>
		<li> Strengthens bones and joints</li>
		<li> Helps reduce risk of injury during day to day activities</li>
		<li> Lowers body fat and burns calories in the long run by building muscle</li>
		<li> Improves heart health</li>
		<li> Improves blood sugar management</li>
		<li> The list goes on and on....</li>
	</ul>
